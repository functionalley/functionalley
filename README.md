### Hello, I'm Al &hellip; no, a *real* person, not *AI*.
`<rant>`

* I write code because most people don't understand what I'm talking about.
* I mostly write it in **Haskell** because of entomophobia (I hate bugs)
  &hellip; &amp; it feels more like a scalpel than an axe.
  If something moderately unpleasant happens to any of the various creators of innumerable untyped or dynamically typed languages,
  then I'll chalk it up to karma;
  **Javascript** is a disaster.
* I release it as *opensource* because that's what I use, I care about freedom, &amp; I'm pretty keen on free.
* I use **Linux** because **MS-Windows** feels like a sensory-deprivation tank
  &hellip; which I'd prefer to anything from **Apple**'s evil empire.
  Satan will be strapping-on his ice-skates before I embrace mobile phones or their ghastly personal data plundering platforms.
