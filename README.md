### Hello, I'm Al ... no, a real person, not AI.

* I write code because most people don't understand what I'm talking about.
* I mostly write it in **Haskell** because of entomophobia (I hate bugs) ... & it feels more like a scalpel than an axe.
* I release it as opensource because that's what I use & I care about freedom.
* I use **Linux** because **MS-Windows** feels like a sensory-deprivation tank & I just can't be bothered with Apple *anything*, Android, ...
