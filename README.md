### Hello, I'm Al ... no a real person, not AI.

* I write code because most people don't understand what I'm talking about.
* I mostly write in Haskell because of entomophobia (I hate bugs) ... & because it's more fun.
* I release it as opensource because that's what I use & I care about freedom.
* I use Linux because Windows feels like someone's chopped my arms off & Apple is just plain evil.
